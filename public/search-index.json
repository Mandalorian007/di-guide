    "title": "Reforging Guide",
    "content": "Reforging is a crucial system in Diablo Immortal that allows you to customize your gear with additional attributes. This guide covers optimal reforging strategies for both PvE and PvP content.\n\n## Understanding Reforging\n\nReforging allows you to add and modify special attributes on your gear. These attributes can significantly enhance your character's performance in specific content types. The reforging system offers:\n\n- Primary attributes that focus on offense or defense\n- Special attributes that enhance specific skills or playstyles\n- Different stones for reforging that target PvE or PvP content\n\n## PvP Reforging Recommendations\n\nFor Battlegrounds and other PvP activities, prioritize these attributes:\n\n| Attribute | Explanation |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Damage to Shielded** | Extremely valuable since many players use shields in PvP |\n| **Damage to Players** | Direct bonus that isn't nerfed in PvP |\n| **Duration of Beneficial Effects** | Extends your buffs for better sustain |\n| **Damage taken while suffering loss of control decreased** | Improves survivability during stuns/freezes |\n| **Damage taken from players reduced** | Direct reduction that isn't nerfed in PvP |\n\nA common swap is damage to shielded vs damage to player suffering loss of control. Both are very effective and certain builds will make one or the other much stronger.\n\n## PvE Reforging Recommendations\n\nFor dungeon runs, raids, and general monster hunting:\n\n| Attribute | Explanation |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Damage to Demons** | Majority of bosses in the game are demons |\n| **Attack Speed** | Increases overall DPS and skill rotation speed |\n| **Duration of Beneficial Effects** | Extends your buffs for more uptime |\n| **Critical Hit Damage** | Multiplies your damage output on crits |\n| **Primary Attack Damage** | One of the highest damage dealers across all classes |\n\n## Interesting stat notes\nPrimary Attack also scales summon's primary attack damage which can make summoning builds or echoing shade setups much stronger."

    "url": "/docs/guides/warbands",
    "title": "Warband Guide",
    "content": "Warbands are small groups of up to 8 players who can participate in specific activities together in Diablo Immortal. This guide covers the current state of warbands, their relevance, and how to optimize your warband remnants.\n\n<Note title=\"Current Relevance\">\n  Most warband activities are now largely irrelevant as long as you are playing regularly with your clan or warband members. However, there are still two important exceptions that make warbands worthwhile.\n</Note>\n\n## Warband Essentials\n\nWarbands were initially designed as a core feature of Diablo Immortal, requiring players to form dedicated groups for specific content. Over time, the game has evolved to reduce dependency on warbands, but they still offer some unique benefits.\n\n### Current Warband Benefits\n\nThere are two main reasons to participate in warband activities:\n\n1. **Weekly Raid Chests**: Running a raid with 4 warband members weekly allows you to farm warband chests and buy a cheap Eternal Crest from the vendor\n2. **Remnant Bonuses**: Running Purges to improve your warband's remnants provides passive bonuses to all warband members\n\n## Warband Remnants\n\nWarband Remnants provide passive bonuses to all warband members when installed in your Warband Castle rooms.\n\n![Warband Remnants Overview](/warband-rems.png)\n\n### Remnant Types\n\nRemnants come in three rarity tiers, each with different stacking rules:\n\n- **White (Common)**: These stack, so having multiple copies of the best ones is ideal\n- **Blue (Rare)**: These do not stack, so you want one copy of each useful blue remnant\n- **Yellow (Legendary)**: These do not stack, so you want one copy of each useful yellow remnant\n\n### Optimal Room Setup\n\nWhile there are several rooms you can upgrade in your Warband Castle, two are particularly important:\n\n#### Attacker Room\n\n- **Best Room Perk**: Damage done increased by 3.5%\n\n#### Defensive Room\n\n- **Best Room Perk**: Increase Block Chance by 5%\n\n<Note>\nThese rooms can be vastly enhanced by the right remnants, which is covered in detail later in this guide.\n</Note>\n\n### Other Important Remnants\n\nFor a well-rounded warband setup, aim to collect:\n- One copy of each yellow remnant\n- One copy of each useful blue remnant\n- Multiple copies of the best white remnants for stacking:\n  - **Protector Room**: Best white remnant is 1.5% block chance\n  - **Attacker Room**: Best white remnants depend on your build:\n    - 1% crit chance\n    - 1.5% primary damage (both are strong options)\n\n## Farming Remnants through Purges\n\nWarband Purges are the primary way to obtain and upgrade your remnants.\n\n### Purge Basics\n\nPurges are special warband dungeons where you can obtain remnants from multiple sources:\n\n- **Monster Kills**: Regular enemies can drop remnants\n- **Gold Chests**: Opening larger gold chests often yields remnants\n- **Wing Bosses**: Each wing boss has a high chance to drop remnants\n- **Final Boss**: The final boss of a purge typically drops higher-quality remnants\n\n<Note>\nRemnant quality (white, blue, yellow) is entirely based on RNG. There's no fusion or upgrading system - you simply need to farm until you get the remnants you want.\n</Note>\n\n### Effective Farming Strategy\n\nAn efficient strategy for purge runs:\n\n1. **Wing Splitting**: Have two players go to the second wing and wait while the rest of the group clears the first wing\n2. **Boss Coordination**: Quickly kill the wing boss when ready\n3. **Third Wing**: While most people fully clear the first wing, have a smaller group speed-open the third wing\n4. **Final Clear**: Work together to complete a full clear and then defeat the final boss\n\n#### Advanced Multi-Warband Technique\n\nFor extremely efficient remnant farming:\n\n<Note>\nThis is an advanced technique that requires coordination across multiple warbands.\n</Note>\n\n1. Have all 8 players be members of **different warbands** (one player per warband)\n2. Run purges together as a group, picking up all remnants\n3. This allows you to effectively farm for 8 different warbands simultaneously\n4. Once one warband has accumulated a good set of remnants, everyone can transfer to that warband\n5. This technique multiplies your farming efficiency by up to 8x\n\n## Weekly Warband Raids\n\nFor optimal weekly benefits:\n\n1. Organize a group of at least 4 warband members\n2. Complete any eligible raid (Helliquary bosses work well)\n3. This allows all participants to claim warband chests\n4. Visit the warband vendor to purchase your discounted Eternal Crest"

    "title": "\"Building DI Guide: A Community-Driven Diablo Immortal Resource\"",
    "content": "## The Vision: Filling the Void Left by MaxRoll\n\nWhen MaxRoll announced they were stepping away from Diablo Immortal coverage, a massive void was left in the community. Their detailed guides, meticulous analysis, and professional approach had become the gold standard for players seeking to master the game. As the Diablo Immortal ecosystem continues to evolve with new content and systems, the need for high-quality resources has only grown.\n\nThat's why I've created DI Guide—a community-driven project aimed at establishing a new standard for Diablo Immortal resources that captures the depth and quality that made MaxRoll so valuable.\n\n## The Core Principles of DI Guide\n\nDI Guide is built on principles that set it apart from typical game guides, with a focus on advanced mechanics and competitive play:\n\n### 1. Competitive Player Insights\n\nOur content comes directly from top-tier players who:\n- Push the boundaries of what's possible in both PvE and PvP\n- Rigorously test mechanics through thousands of hours of gameplay\n- Apply a min-max approach to character optimization\n- Understand the nuances that separate good players from great ones\n\n### 2. Advanced System Optimization\n\nWe focus on the advanced usage of game systems to maximize character power:\n- Detailed breakpoints and diminishing returns analysis\n- Complex interaction mechanics between different abilities and gear\n- Statistical modeling of various build configurations\n- Deep dives into hidden mechanics not explained in-game\n\n### 3. Community-Driven Iteration\n\nWe continuously refine our guides through:\n- Ongoing testing as the meta evolves\n- Feedback from top players across server regions\n- Challenge testing of common assumptions\n- Transparent discussions about findings and methodology\n\n## Join the Mission\n\nBuilding a resource that truly serves the Diablo Immortal community requires passionate contributors from all walks of gameplay:\n\n1. **Knowledge Contributors**: Share your expertise on specific classes, systems, or content\n2. **Data Analysts**: Help us gather and interpret game data to inform recommendations\n3. **Content Creators**: Develop guides, videos, or tools that enhance the player experience\n4. **Community Advocates**: Spread the word and help connect players to these resources\n\nIf you believe in our mission to elevate the Diablo Immortal community's access to high-quality information, we invite you to join us. Visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mandalorian007/di-guide) to see how you can contribute or join the [ThunderClap Discord](https://discord.gg/thunderclap) to connect with our team.\n\nTogether, we can build something that not only fills the void left by MaxRoll but takes Diablo Immortal resources to the next level."
