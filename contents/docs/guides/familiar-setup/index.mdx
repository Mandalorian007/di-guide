# Savior Cooldown Optimization

Understanding the relationship between Resilience and Savior cooldown is crucial for optimal familiar setup. Higher Resilience stats directly reduce your Savior cooldown time. 

Key points:
- Only Duskprowlers and Ash Sweepers can achieve maximum Resilience values
- Maximum Resilience can reduce Savior cooldown by an additional 15 seconds
- This brings the cooldown from the base 75 seconds down to just 60 seconds
- Proper Resilience optimization significantly improves your survival during challenging content

# Advanced Familiar Trait Stacking

Legendary familiar traits can be stacked to provide substantial stat bonuses, but understanding certain mechanics is essential for maximum effectiveness.

Important considerations:
- Traits cannot be stacked using two familiars of the same species - species diversity is required
- Traits can be activated from either a familiar's primary or secondary stat (refer to the Stats Table below)
- Activating a secondary stat requires a double legendary stat familiar
- Strategic trait stacking can dramatically increase your character's power

## Popular Trait Stacking Combinations

Players have developed several effective trait stacking strategies, each with unique advantages:

### Crit & Primary Attack Build
- **Strategy**: Stack MAIM (Crit Chance) with BESTIAL MIGHT (Primary Attack Damage)
- **Familiars**: Four familiars have both traits - Varog, Quakestrider, Broodtalon, and Duskprowler
- **Optimization**: Your fifth familiar can provide additional crit chance or primary attack damage based on your preference
- **Benefit**: Provides exceptional single-target damage output

### PvP Offensive Build
- **Strategy**: Stack FIENDISH HASTE (Damage to Players) 
- **Limitation**: Currently only 4 familiars have this trait (Skitterwight, Stormlost, Quakestrider, Duskprowler)
- **Future Potential**: Watch for new familiar types that could provide the fifth stack
- **Benefit**: Significant advantage in PvP combat situations

### PvP Defensive Build
- **Strategy**: Stack PRESCIENCE (Reduce Player Damage)
- **Optimization**: Use an Ash Sweeper as your main familiar to maximize both this trait and your savior cooldown
- **Benefit**: Dramatically reduces damage taken in PvP, improving survivability
