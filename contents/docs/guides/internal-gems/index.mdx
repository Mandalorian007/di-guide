- Rank 7: Unlocks 3 internal sockets
- Rank 9: Unlocks 4 internal sockets

## Matching Internal Gems to Your Build

While the image provides optimal general recommendations, consider these factors when selecting internal gems:

1. **Class Synergy**: Some gems work better with specific classes (e.g., Bloody Reach for ranged builds)
2. **Content Focus**: PvP may benefit from different gems than PvE content
3. **Play Style**: Aggressive players may prefer offensive gems, while defensive players might choose survival options

## Upgrading Internal Gems

For maximum benefit:

1. Prioritize getting your normal gems to rank 5 before placing them in internal sockets
2. Consider using rank 1-2 legendary gems as placeholders in internal sockets until you can acquire the optimal gems
3. Upgrade internal gems in order of importance (slots 1-2 first, then 3-5)

<Note>
Remember that gem market values fluctuate. If a recommended gem is too expensive, consider alternatives with similar effects that better fit your budget.
