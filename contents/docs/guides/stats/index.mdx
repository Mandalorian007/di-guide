## Stat Priorities

While Diablo Immortal has a lot of stats players have noticed investments in key stats proving to provide considerably more benefit over time. 

The first two stats work well in a pair and it's Cooldown Reduction and Beneficial Effect Duration. These stats together provide uptime on many critical damage and defensive buffs. Getting 100% uptime on key buffs will make a major difference in damage throughput over time.

The next level of stats to consider are critical chance, critical damage, damage to enemy suffering loss of control, and damage per nearby party member. All of these are really strong buffs which affect your damage noticibly. I would recommend getting critical chance as the priority in this category and then stacking as much of the others as you can.
