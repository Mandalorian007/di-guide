Reforging is a crucial system in Diablo Immortal that allows you to customize your gear with additional attributes. This guide covers optimal reforging strategies for both PvE and PvP content.

## Understanding Reforging

Reforging allows you to add and modify special attributes on your gear. These attributes can significantly enhance your character's performance in specific content types. The reforging system offers:

- Primary attributes that focus on offense or defense
- Special attributes that enhance specific skills or playstyles
- Different stones for reforging that target PvE or PvP content

## PvP Reforging Recommendations

For Battlegrounds and other PvP activities, prioritize these attributes:

| Attribute | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Damage to Shielded** | Extremely valuable since many players use shields in PvP |
| **Damage to Players** | Direct bonus that isn't nerfed in PvP |
| **Duration of Beneficial Effects** | Extends your buffs for better sustain |
| **Damage taken while suffering loss of control decreased** | Improves survivability during stuns/freezes |
| **Damage taken from players reduced** | Direct reduction that isn't nerfed in PvP |

A common swap is damage to shielded vs damage to player suffering loss of control. Both are very effective and certain builds will make one or the other much stronger.

## PvE Reforging Recommendations

For dungeon runs, raids, and general monster hunting:

| Attribute | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Damage to Demons** | Majority of bosses in the game are demons |
| **Attack Speed** | Increases overall DPS and skill rotation speed |
| **Duration of Beneficial Effects** | Extends your buffs for more uptime |
| **Critical Hit Damage** | Multiplies your damage output on crits |
| **Primary Attack Damage** | One of the highest damage dealers across all classes |

## Interesting stat notes
Primary Attack also scales summon's primary attack damage which can make summoning builds or echoing shade setups much stronger.
