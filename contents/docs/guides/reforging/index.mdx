Reforging is a crucial system in Diablo Immortal that allows you to customize your gear with additional attributes. This guide covers optimal reforging strategies for both PvE and PvP content.

## Understanding Reforging

Reforging allows you to add and modify special attributes on your gear. These attributes can significantly enhance your character's performance in specific content types. The reforging system offers:

- Primary attributes that focus on offense or defense
- Special attributes that enhance specific skills or playstyles
- Different stones for reforging that target PvE or PvP content

## PvP Reforging Recommendations

For Battlegrounds and other PvP activities, prioritize these attributes:

| Attribute | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Damage to Shielded** | Extremely valuable since many players use shields in PvP |
| **Damage to Players** | Direct bonus that isn't nerfed in PvP |
| **Duration of Beneficial Effects** | Extends your buffs for better sustain |
| **Damage taken while suffering loss of control decreased** | Improves survivability during stuns/freezes |
| **Damage taken from players reduced** | Direct reduction that isn't nerfed in PvP |

When reforging for PvP, use Glowing Shards to target PvP-specific attributes. Stack these attributes across multiple gear pieces for maximum effect.

## PvE Reforging Recommendations

For dungeon runs, raids, and general monster hunting:

| Attribute | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Damage to Demons** | Majority of bosses in the game are demons |
| **Attack Speed** | Increases overall DPS and skill rotation speed |
| **Duration of Beneficial Effects** | Extends your buffs for more uptime |
| **Critical Hit Damage** | Multiplies your damage output on crits |
| **Primary Attack Damage** | One of the highest damage dealers across all classes |

Use Enchanted Dust for PvE reforging to target these attributes. Consider your class and build when prioritizing certain attributes over others.

## Reforging Strategy

### For Efficiency

1. **Set Clear Goals**: Decide if you're targeting PvP or PvE before spending resources
2. **Prioritize Key Items**: Focus on pieces that offer the biggest impact (weapons, chest, etc.)
3. **Balance Resources**: Don't spend all materials on a single piece
4. **Consider Breakpoints**: Some attributes are more valuable at certain thresholds

### For Different Classes

While the recommendations above apply broadly, certain classes may value specific attributes more:

- **Barbarians/Crusaders**: Value attack speed more due to slower base attacks
- **Necromancers/Demon Hunters**: May prioritize skill damage over primary attack
- **Monks/Wizards**: Often benefit from critical hit damage due to higher crit rates

## Advanced Reforging

As you progress with reforging:

1. **Multiple Gear Sets**: Consider maintaining separate gear sets for PvE and PvP
2. **Helliquary Resonance**: Factor in resonance bonuses when deciding reforge priorities
3. **Resource Management**: Save materials for significant upgrades rather than minor improvements

Remember that reforging is a long-term process. Focus on gradually improving your gear rather than trying to perfect everything at once.
