## Legendary Gem Selection

Selecting the right legendary gems for your build is crucial for maximizing your character's power. Different classes and playstyles benefit from different gem combinations.

### Top 5-Star gems
**Core**
- Blood-Soaked Jade (Damage, Damage Redcution, Movement speed)
- Bottled Hope (Damage, Cooldown Reduction, Movement speed)
- Roiling Consequence (Burn, Crit Chance)
- Colosus Engine (skill damage, size -> movement, skill range, and knockback immunity)
- Starfire Shard (Damage, Kockback, Burn)

**Secondary Considerations**
- Blessing of the Worthy (Damage, Damage Reduction, Automatic retaliation)
- Gloom Cask (Damage, Primary Damage scaling debuff)


### Top 2-Star Gems
- Pain Clasp (Huge damage scale for just having an applied damage over time effect)
- Mother's Lament (Huge crit chance)
- Viper's Bite (Easy consistent damage over time which can pair well with pain Clasp)
- Mourneskull (Damage scale)
- Bloody Reach (Damage scale but harder to leverage)
- Kir Sling (Retaliation based crowd control useful in pvp)

### Top 1-Star Gems
- Berserker's Eye (Damage scale)
- Everlasting Torment (easy damage over time if you scale crit chance)
- The Black Rose (Delayed retaliation based pvp gem useful in pvp)

## Auxiliary Gem Options

Auxiliary gems can help you replace the effect of a gem for certain content where you want to keep your stats, but a different effect could be significant boost.

*Top Considerations*
- Echoing Shade: Good for swapping a pvp gem effect for a clone that can deal some damage in a raid
- Frozen Herat: Swap a pve gem for a realiation based chill and a small shield
- Spiteful Blood: Swap a pve gem for small damage buff and immunity to primary attacks for a short duration
- Maw of the Deep: Swap a pve gem for a pull and then knockup
- Stormvault: Makes a large aoe that chases. Good for appling damage over time for certain builds.

### Understanding Gem Power Calculations

- **Gem Power**: The amount of gem power needed for each rank upgrade
- **Duplicate Requirements**: Some ranks require specific gem duplicates of particular ranks
- **Cumulative Total**: The total amount of gem power needed from rank 1 to the specified rank (Does not include the original rank 1 copy)
- **Dupes**: The number in parentheses indicates the total number of duplicates needed at that point
