| 8    | 656 (6560)               | 2,187        | 21             |
| 9    | 952 (9520)               | 6,561        | 66             |
| 10   | 1,256 (12560)            | 19,683       | 201            |

## Optimal Gem Arrangement

Most of the time players will balance sapphires and aquamarines as well as the citrines and topazes. There is a general concensus amoung players that damage is more valuable than health so usually players will run one ruby or zero rubies and the rest of the red slots will be Tourmalines. Another common convention amoung players is that for non damage over time centric builds blue gems are generally valued more than yellow gems so ring slots are usually used as blues.

## Farming Strategy

There are two main sources of farmable gems:

**Weekly Lairs / Verges / Erebban**
The easiest way to achieve these is get a solid group of 4 players and chain Verges back to back where you all run separate routes. 

**Daily Party Gems**
You get these from playing in a party with 4 other players in the same zone. You can see completion in your character's buff bar while you meet the previously mentioned conditions. The fastest way to complete these is about 15 minutes of the group farming your clan's towers. However, now that we have pets that can cap these it's usually recommend to do terror rifts. Dungeon spam works as well, but you will need quite a while to cap.

## Iben Fhads details

**Understanding Iben's estimates**
- A vessel level up provides 18 points of stat increase
- Stones per full iben fahd clear is roughly 1,866 (this is factoring the "crits" where a chest provides bonus gems)
- Ibens costs 18,000 platinum to clear
- Roughly 9.646 platinum per stone for math

**Notes**
- All rooms effectively give you 4.5 stones per key as the average. (Doesn't matter how you open things)
- Note free chest should be opened every day. You can use familiars for this and not lose anything.

### Gem Cost Calculator

Use the calculator below to compare normal gem costs with Iben Fahd's Sanctum efficiency. Adjust the platinum price per gem to see how market fluctuations affect your investment decisions. The "Plat/Point" column shows the platinum cost per stat point, and the "Iben Equivalent" column shows which Iben Fahd rank has the closest platinum cost per stat point efficiency (with total Iben cost in parentheses).
