# Warband Guide

Warbands are small groups of up to 8 players who can participate in specific activities together in Diablo Immortal. This guide covers the current state of warbands, their relevance, and how to optimize your warband remnants.

<Note title="Current Relevance">
  Most warband activities are now largely irrelevant as long as you are playing regularly with your clan or warband members. However, there are still two important exceptions that make warbands worthwhile.
</Note>

## Warband Essentials

Warbands were initially designed as a core feature of Diablo Immortal, requiring players to form dedicated groups for specific content. Over time, the game has evolved to reduce dependency on warbands, but they still offer some unique benefits.

### Current Warband Benefits

There are two main reasons to participate in warband activities:

1. **Weekly Raid Chests**: Running a raid with 4 warband members weekly allows you to farm warband chests and buy a cheap Eternal Crest from the vendor
2. **Remnant Bonuses**: Running Purges to improve your warband's remnants provides passive bonuses to all warband members

## Warband Remnants

Warband Remnants provide passive bonuses to all warband members when installed in your Warband Castle rooms.

### Remnant Types

Remnants come in three rarity tiers, each with different stacking rules:

- **White (Common)**: These stack, so having multiple copies of the best ones is ideal
- **Blue (Rare)**: These do not stack, so you want one copy of each useful blue remnant
- **Yellow (Legendary)**: These do not stack, so you want one copy of each useful yellow remnant

### Optimal Room Setup

While there are several rooms you can upgrade in your Warband Castle, two are particularly important:

#### Attacker Room

The Attacker Room provides offensive bonuses:

- **Best Room Perk**: Damage done increased by 3.5%
- **Best Remnant Perk**: Straight damage increase remnants
- **Priority Remnant**: "Manifest Courage" (white) which increases damage against enemies with full health
- **Secondary Options**: Any remnants that increase your critical hit chance or damage

#### Defensive Room

The Defensive Room provides survivability bonuses:

- **Best Room Perk**: Increase Block Chance by 5%
- **Best Remnant Perk**: Block chance remnants
- **Priority Remnant**: "Shepherd's Burden" (white) which increases your life and provides block chance
- **Secondary Options**: Any remnants that increase health or resistance

### Other Important Remnants

For a well-rounded warband setup, aim to collect:
- One copy of each yellow remnant
- One copy of each useful blue remnant
- Multiple copies of the best white remnants for stacking

## Farming Remnants through Purges

Warband Purges are the primary way to obtain and upgrade your remnants.

### Purge Basics

Purges are special warband dungeons where you:
1. Clear waves of enemies
2. Defeat bosses
3. Earn remnants as rewards

### Effective Farming Strategy

<Note title="TODO">
  This section will be expanded with detailed strategies for efficiently running Warband Purges to farm optimal remnants.
</Note>

Some basic tips for Purge farming:
1. Coordinate with your warband to run purges regularly
2. Focus on higher difficulty purges for better remnant quality
3. Prioritize completing purges quickly rather than getting a perfect score
4. Communicate which remnants you're looking for with your warband

## Weekly Warband Raids

For optimal weekly benefits:

1. Organize a group of at least 4 warband members
2. Complete any eligible raid (Helliquary bosses work well)
3. This allows all participants to claim warband chests
4. Visit the warband vendor to purchase your discounted Eternal Crest

## Warband Castle Activities

Your Warband Castle provides several other activities and benefits:

1. **Defense Quests**: Defend your castle against waves of enemies
2. **Portal Room**: Access to dungeons and raids directly from your castle
3. **Trophy Room**: Display achievements and earn additional bonuses
4. **Meeting Hall**: Plan activities with your warband members

While these activities aren't essential, they provide additional resources and bonuses that can help your character progression.
