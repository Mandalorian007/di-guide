description: Understanding Warbands, their relevance, and optimizing Warband Remnants
---

Warbands are small groups of up to 8 players who can participate in specific activities together in Diablo Immortal. This guide covers the current state of warbands, their relevance, and how to optimize your warband remnants.

<Note title="Current Relevance">
  Most warband activities are now largely irrelevant as long as you are playing regularly with your clan or warband members. However, there are still two important exceptions that make warbands worthwhile.
</Note>

## Warband Essentials

Warbands were initially designed as a core feature of Diablo Immortal, requiring players to form dedicated groups for specific content. Over time, the game has evolved to reduce dependency on warbands, but they still offer some unique benefits.

### Current Warband Benefits

There are two main reasons to participate in warband activities:

1. **Weekly Raid Chests**: Running a raid with 4 warband members weekly allows you to farm warband chests and buy a cheap Eternal Crest from the vendor
2. **Remnant Bonuses**: Running Purges to improve your warband's remnants provides passive bonuses to all warband members

## Warband Remnants

Warband Remnants provide passive bonuses to all warband members when installed in your Warband Castle rooms.

### Remnant Types

Remnants come in three rarity tiers, each with different stacking rules:

- **White (Common)**: These stack, so having multiple copies of the best ones is ideal
- **Blue (Rare)**: These do not stack, so you want one copy of each useful blue remnant
- **Yellow (Legendary)**: These do not stack, so you want one copy of each useful yellow remnant

### Optimal Room Setup

While there are several rooms you can upgrade in your Warband Castle, two are particularly important:

#### Attacker Room

- **Best Room Perk**: Damage done increased by 3.5%

#### Defensive Room

- **Best Room Perk**: Increase Block Chance by 5%

<Note>
These rooms can be vastly enhanced by the right remnants, which is covered in detail later in this guide.
</Note>

### Other Important Remnants

For a well-rounded warband setup, aim to collect:
- One copy of each yellow remnant
- One copy of each useful blue remnant
- Multiple copies of the best white remnants for stacking:
  - **Protector Room**: Best white remnant is 1.5% block chance
  - **Attacker Room**: Best white remnants depend on your build:
    - 1% crit chance
    - 1.5% primary damage (both are strong options)

## Farming Remnants through Purges

Warband Purges are the primary way to obtain and upgrade your remnants.

### Purge Basics

Purges are special warband dungeons where you can obtain remnants from multiple sources:

- **Monster Kills**: Regular enemies can drop remnants
- **Gold Chests**: Opening larger gold chests often yields remnants
- **Wing Bosses**: Each wing boss has a high chance to drop remnants
- **Final Boss**: The final boss of a purge typically drops higher-quality remnants

### Remnant Levels

Each remnant can be upgraded through fusion to increase its power:

- The current maximum level for remnants is level 9 (there are unconfirmed reports of level 10)
- Higher-level remnants provide stronger bonuses
- Duplicate remnants can be used to upgrade existing ones

### Effective Farming Strategy

<Note title="TODO">
  This section will be expanded with detailed strategies for efficiently running Warband Purges to farm optimal remnants.
</Note>

Some basic tips for Purge farming:
1. Coordinate with your warband to run purges regularly
2. Focus on higher difficulty purges for better remnant quality
3. Prioritize opening all gold chests and defeating all bosses
4. When speed farming, consider which bosses drop the remnants you need
5. Communicate which remnants you're looking for with your warband

## Weekly Warband Raids

For optimal weekly benefits:

1. Organize a group of at least 4 warband members
2. Complete any eligible raid (Helliquary bosses work well)
3. This allows all participants to claim warband chests
4. Visit the warband vendor to purchase your discounted Eternal Crest

## Warband Castle Activities

Your Warband Castle provides several other activities and benefits:

1. **Defense Quests**: Defend your castle against waves of enemies
2. **Portal Room**: Access to dungeons and raids directly from your castle
3. **Trophy Room**: Display achievements and earn additional bonuses
4. **Meeting Hall**: Plan activities with your warband members

While these activities aren't essential, they provide additional resources and bonuses that can help your character progression.
