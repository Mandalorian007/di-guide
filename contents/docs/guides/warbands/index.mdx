description: Understanding Warbands, their relevance, and optimizing Warband Remnants
---

Warbands are small groups of up to 12 players who can participate (up to 8 at a time) in specific activities together in Diablo Immortal. This guide covers the current state of warbands, their relevance, and how to optimize your warband remnants.

<Note title="Current Relevance">
  Most warband activities are now largely irrelevant as long as you are playing regularly with your clan or warband members. However, there are still two important exceptions that make warbands worthwhile.
</Note>

## Warband Essentials

Warbands were initially designed as a core feature of Diablo Immortal, requiring players to form dedicated groups for specific content. Over time, the game has evolved to reduce dependency on warbands, but they still offer some unique benefits.

### Current Warband Benefits

There are two main reasons to participate in warband activities:

1. **Weekly Raid Chests**: Running a raid with 4 warband members weekly allows you to farm warband chests and buy a cheap Eternal Crest from the vendor
2. **Remnant Bonuses**: Running Purges to improve your warband's remnants provides passive bonuses to all warband members

## Warband Remnants

Warband Remnants provide passive bonuses to all warband members when installed in your Warband Castle rooms.

### Remnant Types

Remnants come in three rarity tiers, each with different stacking rules:

- **Ordinary (White)**: These stack, so having multiple copies of the best ones is ideal
- **Magic (Blue)**: These do not stack, so you want one copy of each useful blue remnant
- **Rare (Yellow)**: These do not stack, so you want one copy of each useful yellow remnant

### Optimal Room Setup

While there are several rooms you can upgrade in your Warband Castle, two are particularly important:

#### Attacker Room

- **Best Room Perk**: Damage done increased by 3.5%

#### Protector Room

- **Best Room Perk**: Increase Block Chance by 5%

<Note>
These rooms can be vastly enhanced by the right remnants, which is covered in detail later in this guide.
</Note>

### Other Important Remnants

For a well-rounded warband setup, aim to collect:
- One copy of each yellow remnant
- One copy of each useful blue remnant
- Multiple copies of the best white remnants for stacking:
  - **Protector Room**: Best white remnant is 1.5% block chance
  - **Attacker Room**: Best white remnants depend on your build:
    - 1% crit chance
    - 1.5% primary damage (both are strong options)

## Farming Remnants through Purges

Warband Purges are the primary way to obtain and upgrade your remnants.

### Purge Basics

Purges are special warband dungeons where you can obtain remnants from multiple sources:

- **Monster Kills**: Regular enemies can drop remnants
- **Gold Chests**: Opening larger gold chests often yields remnants
- **Wing Bosses**: Each wing boss has a high chance to drop remnants
- **Final Boss**: The final boss of a purge typically drops higher-quality remnants

<Note>
Remnant quality (white, blue, yellow) is entirely based on RNG. There's no fusion or upgrading system - you simply need to farm until you get the remnants you want.
</Note>

### Effective Farming Strategy

An efficient strategy for purge runs:

1. **Wing Splitting**: Have two players go to the second wing and wait while the rest of the group clears the first wing
2. **Boss Coordination**: Quickly kill the wing boss when ready
3. **Third Wing**: While most people fully clear the first wing, have a smaller group speed-open the third wing
4. **Final Clear**: Work together to complete a full clear and then defeat the final boss

#### Advanced Multi-Warband Technique

For extremely efficient remnant farming:

<Note>
This is an advanced technique that requires coordination across multiple warbands.
</Note>

1. Have all 8 players be members of **different warbands** (one player per warband)
2. Run purges together as a group, picking up all remnants
3. This allows you to effectively farm for 8 different warbands simultaneously
4. Once one warband has accumulated a good set of remnants, everyone can transfer to that warband
5. This technique multiplies your farming efficiency by up to 8x

## Weekly Warband Raids

For optimal weekly benefits:

1. Organize a group of at least 4 warband members
2. Complete any eligible raid (Helliquary bosses work well)
3. This allows all participants to claim warband chests
4. Visit the warband vendor to purchase your discounted Eternal Crest
