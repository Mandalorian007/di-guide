## Adding New Content

### Documentation and Guides

Our documentation is written in MDX, which allows you to use React components within Markdown:

1. **Create a new guide**: Add a new directory under `contents/docs/` following the site structure
2. **Add index.mdx file**: Create an `index.mdx` file with proper frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: Your Guide Title
description: A brief description of your guide
---

# Your Guide Content

Write your guide content here using Markdown and MDX components.
```

3. **Update navigation**: If needed, update the `lib/routes-config.ts` file to add your guide to the navigation menu

### Class Builds

For class build guides, follow this structure:

1. Create a new directory under `contents/docs/class-builds/` with the class name (e.g., `barbarian`)
2. Add content following our established format
3. Include sections for abilities, legendary items, set items, and build variations
