## Documentation

1. **Configure Routing**

   - Open the `@lib/route-config.ts` file and add your routing pages:

   
     ```typescript:route-config.ts
     export const ROUTES: EachRoute[] = [
       // Add new route below
       {
         title: "Fundamentals",
         href: "/fundamentals",
         noLink: true, // Set to true to prevent routing
         items: [
           // All the sub-sections under `fundamentals`
           { title: "HTTP Server", href: "/http-server" },
         ],
       },
     ];
     ```

2. **Create Content Structure**

   - Navigate to the `@content/docs` directory and create a folder named `fundamentals`, as defined in the `route-config` file. Within this folder, create a subfolder named `http-server`, and inside that, create an `index.mdx` file that will render when you navigate to `/fundamentals/http-server`:

<Files
  items={[
    {
      type: "folder",
      name: "content",
      isOpen: true,
      children: [
        {
          type: "folder",
          name: "docs",
          isOpen: true,
          children: [
            {
              type: "folder",
              name: "fundamentals",
              isOpen: true,
              children: [
                {
                  type: "folder",
                  name: "http-server",
                  isOpen: true,
                  children: [{ type: "file", name: "index.mdx" }],
                },
              ],
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>


3. **Write Your Markdown Content**
   - Start writing your markdown content inside the `index.mdx` file.

<Note type="warning">
  Be sure to include frontmatter at the beginning of the file, which is used for
  the page title and description:

     ```markdown:index.mdx showLineNumbers {1-4}

     title: HTTP Server
     description: This section is about HTTP Server.
     ---

     <!-- Here goes your markdown content -->
     ```

4. **Run Your Application**
   - Ensure your application is running. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/docs/fundamentals/http-server` to view your content. You should also see it in the left panel, allowing you to navigate to other pages.

## Blogs
