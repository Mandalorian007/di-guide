## The Vision: Filling the Void Left by MaxRoll

When MaxRoll announced they were stepping away from Diablo Immortal coverage, a massive void was left in the community. Their detailed guides, meticulous analysis, and professional approach had become the gold standard for players seeking to master the game. As the Diablo Immortal ecosystem continues to evolve with new content and systems, the need for high-quality resources has only grown.

That's why I've created DI Guideâ€”a community-driven project aimed at establishing a new standard for Diablo Immortal resources that captures the depth and quality that made MaxRoll so valuable.

## The Core Principles of DI Guide

Creating a resource that matches the caliber of what MaxRoll offered requires adherence to several core principles:

### 1. Accuracy Above All

Every piece of information we publish undergoes rigorous testing and verification. We're committed to:
- Testing mechanics in-game before documenting them
- Providing proof for claims through gameplay evidence
- Clearly distinguishing between confirmed information and theory

### 2. Comprehensive Coverage

Our aim is to cover every aspect of Diablo Immortal with the depth it deserves:
- Detailed class guides with multiple build options
- In-depth system explanations (Paragon, Helliquary, Warband, etc.)
- Constantly updated information on new content and patches
- Advanced mechanics and hidden systems explained in plain language

### 3. Community Collaboration

What makes DI Guide unique is its collaborative foundation:
- Open source development allows any passionate player to contribute
- Expert players from the ThunderClap community provide specialist knowledge
- Regular feedback loops ensure content remains relevant and accurate
- Recognizing contributors who help build this resource

## Moving Beyond What Came Before

While inspired by MaxRoll, our vision extends beyond simply recreating what they offered:

### Deeper Build Customization

We're developing tools that will allow players to:
- Experiment with different skill and gear combinations in interactive build planners
- See statistical projections for different build configurations
- Share and rate community builds with detailed explanations

### Contextual Recommendations

Our guides recognize that there's rarely a one-size-fits-all solution:
- Content-specific recommendations (Dungeons vs. Overworld vs. PvP)
- Spending-tier appropriate advice (F2P, Low Spender, Whale)
- Path to progression recommendations rather than just end-game targets

### Live Data Integration

We're working toward integrating live game data:
- Real-time market prices for legendary gems
- Server population statistics and faction balance information
- Dungeon activity metrics to help players find groups more efficiently

## Join the Mission

Building a resource that truly serves the Diablo Immortal community requires passionate contributors from all walks of gameplay:

2. **Data Analysts**: Help us gather and interpret game data to inform recommendations
3. **Content Creators**: Develop guides, videos, or tools that enhance the player experience
4. **Community Advocates**: Spread the word and help connect players to these resources
